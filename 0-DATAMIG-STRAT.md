# Data Migration Strategy Document [p.133]

> It needs to spell out how you [â€¦] are going to get the right data from the right sources to the right quality to the right place at the right time. It will include an indicative plan with replanning steps in it preceeding each of the subsequent stages. It will spell out what support you are expecting from the wider programme and what project office functions you are going to be calling on. It will also explain how your project is going to interface back into the wider programme and the format of inter-stream deliverables. The scope of a data migration project - both what it include and what it will exclude - will be specified. [p.140f]
